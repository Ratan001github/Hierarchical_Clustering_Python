# Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that groups similar data points or objects into groups called clusters. It is a bottom-up approach where each data point initially represents its own cluster, and clusters are successively merged or divided based on their similarity until a certain criterion is met.

## Key Concepts

- **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**: It starts with individual data points as clusters and then merges the closest pairs of clusters until only one cluster remains.

  
- **Divisive Hierarchical Clustering**: It starts with all data points in one cluster and then divides them recursively into smaller clusters until each data point is in its own cluster.

  
- **Distance Metric**: Hierarchical clustering uses a distance metric to measure the similarity between data points or clusters. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and cosine similarity.

  
- **Dendrogram**: A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that illustrates the arrangement of the clusters produced by hierarchical clustering. It shows the order in which clusters are merged or divided and the distance at which each merge or division occurs.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure the data is in a format suitable for hierarchical clustering, typically a distance or similarity matrix.

2. **Choosing Distance Metric**:
   - Select an appropriate distance metric based on the nature of the data and the problem domain.

3. **Selecting Linkage Method**:
   - Choose a linkage method to determine how the distance between clusters is calculated. Common linkage methods include single linkage, complete linkage, and average linkage.

4. **Creating Dendrogram**:
   - Use the hierarchical clustering algorithm to create a dendrogram, which visualizes the clustering process and helps determine the optimal number of clusters.

5. **Cutting the Dendrogram**:
   - Based on the dendrogram, decide on the appropriate number of clusters by cutting the tree at a suitable height.

6. **Assigning Data Points to Clusters**:
   - Assign each data point to the appropriate cluster based on the clustering results.
